# Main quest

Nothing to see here :)

# Side quests

- Maybe make backend status messages enums fit the http status codes instead of converting with a util function
- Rename userLevel to auth in frontend (auth >= requiredAuth etc.)
- Change name of updateDBAndSessions in backend
- Clean up and improve styles

# Completed main quests

- Make login persistent
- Make proper logout
